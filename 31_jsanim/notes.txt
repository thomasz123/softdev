K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2023-04-25t

DISCO:
* window.requestAnimationFrame(function) requests that the browser calls the function to update an animation before the next frame.
* window.cancelAnimationFrame(function) cancels/stops the request for the browser to repeatedly call the function. 
* In order to create an animation, you have to clear the screen before painting every new frame.
* To stop the function from being called multiple times in one frame, you have to call window.cancelAnimationFrame(function) before painting the next frame.

QCC:
* What is the purpose of the parameter e? It doesn't seem to affect anything.
* Is the requestAnimationFrame() function stackable?
