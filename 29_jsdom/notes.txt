K29 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-20r

DISCO:
* In order to create a button that will output the inputs...
    * Set the button equal to a variable using document.getElementById("buttonID").
    * Create a function containing:
        * Set the input text equal to a variable.
        * Get the value of the input text (inputTextVar = inputTextVar.value).
        * Get the innerHTML of the output text and set it equal to the output of the function.
    * Lastly, add an event listener to the button that will run the function in the previous step on click.
* We need to create a separate function in order to make buttons that will output something on click.

QCC:
* Why do we need '() => function()' as the second argument in the addEventListener() function?
* We understood the basic idea, but it took a little bit to get all of the steps in the right order.
