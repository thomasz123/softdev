K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-05w

DISCO:
* console.log() displays a string in the console.
* You don't need to specify the type of variable when declaring it.
* Functions are assigned to variables.
* classList.add("className") adds a class with the name "className".
* document.getElementById("idName") get the element with the name "idName".
* document.getElementsByTagName("tagName") gets the items with the <tagName>.
* In both red() and stripe(), blue take precedent over red.

QCC:
* Why are the red() and stripe() functions not properly working? Is the blue class overriding the red class?
* Why are the results different everytime for red() and stripe()?
