K12 -- Making a form using templates and the difference between post and get  
2022-10-17  
time spent: 1 hour  

You need methods=['GET', 'POST'] in order to load a webpage using post.  
request.method returns the request method NOT request.  
You can cat a string to render_template to have both the return statement and the html.
