K32 -- canvas based JS drawing

DISCO:
* preventDefault() prevents an action from being taken.
    * In this case, preventDefault() affects the Animaniac and DVD buttons only since their functions invoke clear(), which has preventDefault().
    * However, the stop button function does not invoke clear(), so it is not affected by preventDefault().
* The canvas is like an inverted coordinate system and the logo is created from the top left.
* The xVel and yVel served as a change in direction/slope, which allows us to create the illusion of a DVD logo bouncing off the walls of the canvas.

QCC:
* How can we make the logo not spawn on the edge?
* Make sure to actually invoke the function after creating it or else nothing happens!
